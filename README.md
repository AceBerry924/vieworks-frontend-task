# Vieworks Frontend Test

## Overview

This project is for Vieworks company Front-end challenge.
This one detects the event and controls for video(eg: Youtube, Vimeo, ...) using `react-player` and `styled-components`.

## Task Description

At Vieworks it is important for us to catch any interaction between our video player and users.
That’s why we want you to create a simple React project with embedded any YouTube video ( or
Vimeo video you choose), and collect events like play video, stopped video, video ended etc. You can
write console log or any other way you choose to collect events.

## Bonus Point​:

You can impress us if you can calculate how much percentage of the video is watched. If
a user watched until the middle of the video, the percentage should be %50, if ​¾​ of the video
watched percentage should be %75
